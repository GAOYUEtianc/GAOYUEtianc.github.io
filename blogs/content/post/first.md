Welcome to my blog ðŸ˜Š

I'll share my reading summaries and maybe also some random research thoughts/feelings, hopefully, in every two weeks. The topics may include reinforcement learning, bandit, machine learning, differential privacy and so on. You're more than welcome to comment on my posts, and I'll be even happier if you could recommend papers or books to me. Besides ML \& RL, I also enjoy reading geography/literature/sci-fi. 

English is my second language, I apologize if the grammar isnâ€™t up to scratch on some of my posts.
